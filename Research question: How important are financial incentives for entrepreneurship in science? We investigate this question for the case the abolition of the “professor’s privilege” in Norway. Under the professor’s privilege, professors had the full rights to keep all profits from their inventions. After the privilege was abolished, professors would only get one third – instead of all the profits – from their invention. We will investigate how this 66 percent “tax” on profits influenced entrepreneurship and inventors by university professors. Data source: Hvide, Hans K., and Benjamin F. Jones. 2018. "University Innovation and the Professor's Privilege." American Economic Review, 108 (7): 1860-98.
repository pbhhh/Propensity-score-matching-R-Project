# Research question: How important are financial incentives for entrepreneurship in science? We investigate this question for the case the abolition of the “professor’s privilege” in Norway. Under the professor’s privilege,
professors had the full rights to keep all profits from their inventions. After the privilege was abolished, professors would only get one third – instead of all the profits – from their invention. We will investigate how this 66 percent
“tax” on profits influenced entrepreneurship and inventors by university professors.
